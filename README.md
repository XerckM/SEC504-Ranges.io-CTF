# SEC504 Ranges.io CTF Walkthroughs  

This repository contains my personal write-ups from the **SEC504 Ranges.io Capture the Flag (CTF)**, completed as part of my preparation for the **GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)** certification.  

Unlike a simple “answer key,” these walkthroughs are written to capture my **thought process**, the **challenges I faced**, and the **realistic problem-solving steps** I used. My goal was to document this experience in a way that demonstrates not only the solutions but also the **mindset and technical depth required in real-world incident response.**

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here  

- **Step-by-step walkthroughs** written in a narrative style — how I was thinking while trying to solve each challenge.
- **Hands-on techniques** including reconnaissance, enumeration, fuzzing, and web exploitation.  
- **Realistic obstacles and dead-ends** I encountered, and how I adapted to overcome them.  
- **Tools in action**: `ffuf`, `nmap`, shell scripting, Python, CyberChef, and manual browser analysis, etc.  
- **Flags and answers are hidden by default** using expandable sections (`<details>` in Markdown), so readers can test themselves before revealing solutions.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated  

By working through these challenges, I showcased key incident handling and penetration testing skills:  

- **Web Exploitation** → XSS, SQL Injection testing, URL tampering, logic flaw exploitation  
- **Fuzzing & Automation** → Using `ffuf`, Bash, and Python to enumerate hidden resources  
- **OSINT & Reconnaissance** → Leveraging open-source intelligence tools and search strategies  
- **Incident Handling Mindset** → Careful documentation, iterative testing, and adapting when the “obvious” solution failed  

These skills directly translate into **SOC analysis, penetration testing, and threat hunting roles**, where methodical reasoning is just as important as technical execution.

## 🎯 Why This Matters  

I created this repository as both a **study aid** and a **professional showcase**:  

- For **students** → It provides a clear example of how to go beyond simply “finding flags” and instead demonstrate **deep technical reasoning**.  
- For **employers** → It reflects my ability to **document investigations**, **analyze systems under pressure**, and **communicate findings clearly** — the same skills I bring to incident handling and cybersecurity operations.
